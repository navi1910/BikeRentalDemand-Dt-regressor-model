# Bike Rental Demand Prediction project
## Regression project
Regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous traget variables using set of features/attributes.

## Project Objective
The aim of the project is to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast hourly bike rental demand.

## Methods
- Data Visualization
- Data Transformation
- Heatmaps for correlation
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building
- Predictive Modelling
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

## Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas
- matplotlib and seaborn
- sci-kit learn

## Project Description
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of
obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of
kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an
as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs
around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for
researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival
location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems
therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying
mobility in a city.

We use __Regression__ in order to predict the **Hourly Bike Rental Demands across various weather conditions, seasons and holidays in this project**.

## Procedure
- Import the required modules for Python.
- Import the training data as a Data Frame.
- Print the head of the data.
- `'count'` is indentified as the Target Variable.
- Distribution of `'count'` is plotted.
![count_dist](https://github.com/navi1910/BikeRentalDemand-dt-regressor-model/blob/master/count_dist.png 'count_dist')
- Since `'count'` is skewed log transformation is applied and then plotted.
![count_transformed](https://github.com/navi1910/BikeRentalDemand-dt-regressor-model/blob/master/count_dist_transformed.png 'count_transformed')
- The basic `info` is checked.
- Heatmap is plotted to check the correlation among the variables.
![heatmap](https://github.com/navi1910/BikeRentalDemand-dt-regressor-model/blob/master/heatmap.png 'heatmap')
- The correlation between `'atemp'` and `'count'` is ignorable. Hence, `'atemp'` is dropped.
- Another heatmap with annotations is plotted for the attributes.
![heatmap_annot](https://github.com/navi1910/BikeRentalDemand-dt-regressor-model/blob/master/heatmap_with_annot.png 'heatmap_annot')
- Feature Engineering on `'datetime'` is done to extract `'date'` and `'hour'`.
- The data is divided into Training and Validation Set.
- The independent and dependent variables are separated for both Training and Validation sets.

## Model Building
### Linear Regression
- `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` is initialized using `lmodel`.
- `X_train` and `y_train` are fit to `lmodel`.
- Prediction of `y_val` is done by applying `predict` on `X_val`.
- Function for calculation Root Mean Squared Error is defined as `rmse`.
- The model scores are calculated.

### Decision Tree Regressor
- `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `sklearn.tree` is initialized suing `dtr`.
- `X_train` and `y_train` are fit to `dtr`.
- Prediction of `y_val` is done by applying `predict` on `X_val`.
- The model scores are calculated.

## Model Testing
- Test data is imported as a Data Frame.
- Feature Engineering and Data Transformation is done on Testing data.
- `predict` is used to obtain predictions.
- csv file of predicted values is created as `'submission.csv'`.

## Model Results
- Linear Regression
    - R-squared score = 0.6079677309190348
    - Root Mean Squared Error = 0.8875420172296656

- Decision Tree Regressor
    - R-squared score = **0.9989142100468114**
    - Root Mean Square Error = **0.047788211756583474**

#### Here Decision Tree Regressor (dtr) is evidently the best model.
